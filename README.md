# Automated-Shuffleboard-Scorer

**Description**
Unlike Air Hockey, shuffleboard leaves it to the players to calculate score. The purpose of this project was to fully automate a scoring of a shuffleboard game. The goals for the project were to:
  1. Keep track of the turns taken of the current round
  2. Keep track of what players turn it was
  3. Display the score onto a OLED screen
  4. Calculate the score of the round

**Features**
The features this project utlized was a rasberry pi to run the program on. I utlized embedded python to program all the I/O ports and any periphals utlized. What makes this program unique is the ability to capture a picture and calculate the score of the round from that picture.  
The periphals utlized were:
  * USB Camera
  * Laser
  * LDR Sensor
  * OLED Screen
  * LED Lights

**Programming Language:** Python
**Libraries/Frameworks:** OpenCV
**Environment:** Desktop
